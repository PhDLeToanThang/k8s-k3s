This architecture describes deploying a microservices application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications easy.

The architecture consists of the following components:

✅AKS cluster: The AKS cluster is the foundation of the architecture. It provides the infrastructure for running the microservices application.

✅Virtual network: The virtual network isolates the AKS cluster from the rest of the Azure network. It also provides a private network for the microservices application to communicate with each other.

✅Ingress controller: The ingress controller is responsible for routing traffic to the different microservices in the application.

✅Azure Load Balancer: The Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic evenly across the nodes in the AKS cluster.

✅Azure Container Registry: The Azure Container Registry is a private Docker registry for storing the Docker images for the microservices application.

✅Azure Pipelines: Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that can be used to build, test, and deploy the microservices application to AKS.

✅Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that can be used to manage the Kubernetes manifests for the microservices application.

✅Azure Monitor: Azure Monitor collects and stores metrics, logs, and traces for the microservices application. It can be used to monitor the health of the application and troubleshoot problems.

𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬:

The following steps describe the process for deploying a microservices application to AKS using this architecture:

☑️Create an AKS cluster.

☑️Create a virtual network for the AKS cluster.

☑️Deploy the ingress controller to the AKS cluster.

☑️Create an Azure Load Balancer.

☑️Create an Azure Container Registry.

☑️Push the Docker images for the microservices application to the Azure Container Registry.

☑️Create a Helm chart for the microservices application.
